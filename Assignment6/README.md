### Probability 

*Marginal probability*: the probability of an event occurring (p(A)), it may be thought of as an unconditional probability.  It is not conditioned on another event.

*Joint probability*:  p(A and B).  The probability of event A and event B occurring.  It is the probability of the intersection of two or more events.

*Conditional probability*:  p(A|B) is the probability of event A occurring, given that event B occurs.
